# Datasets
## Finetuning Data
We provide three different fine-tuning datasets, each split into train and test files.

- __Equalities__ (=):  Train and Test
- __Inequalities__ (< and â‰¤ ): Train and Test

The fine-tuning data is based on the arxiv publications listed in the meta-datafile. When using the fine-tuning data in a downstream evaluation, make sure that your base-model is not trained on the same papers.
For sake of completeness, we have included the list of papers we used for pretraining.

- __Fine-Tuning Papers:__ Metadata 
- __Pre-Training Papers:__ Metadata
